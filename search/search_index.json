This custom platform will streamline the process of organizing volunteer events and shifts, enabling administrators to create and manage events, track volunteer attendance, and send timely notifications. Volunteers will benefit from a simple user-friendly way to easily sign up for shifts, view upcoming events, and receive reminders. The primary users of this system will be the administrators and volunteers of Bleeding Heart Art Space. The platform will be used to simplify volunteer coordination, improve communication, and optimize event management, contributing to the smooth operation of the community art space. Project Glossary Admin : A user with elevated permissions responsible for managing events, assigning roles, and organizing schedules. Admins can create, edit, and delete events, assign volunteers to shifts, and oversee overall operations. They also have the ability to sign up for volunteer shifts themselves. Volunteer : A general user who participates in events and activities organized by admins. Volunteers can view available events, sign up for shifts, check in and out of events, and receive notifications and reminders. Artist : A user responsible for requesting events that have to be approved by the admins. In some cases, the artist might also participate in events or activities organized by the volunteers and admins, especially if the event centers around an art exhibit or installation. Event : A scheduled activity that requires volunteers. Events are created and managed by admins and can have specific times, dates, locations, and roles. Volunteers sign up for these events. Shift : A designated time slot within an event during which volunteers are expected to participate. Shifts may have specific start and end times. Calendar : A calendar meant to organize volunteers for an event. It may include multiple shifts and volunteers may use it to sign up for different time slots. Notifications : Alerts sent to users via email or app to remind them of upcoming events or other important information. Volunteers and admins can subscribe or unsubscribe from notifications. Permissions : Access rights assigned by an admin to other users. Permissions determine what actions a user can perform, such as creating events or managing schedules. Roles : Specific functions or duties that volunteers might be assigned within an event (e.g., setup, registration, crowd control). Admins can assign roles when creating events. Dashboard : A centralized page where admins can monitor events, volunteer sign-ups, attendance, and manage schedules. Volunteers may also have a dashboard to view upcoming events they are signed up for.
