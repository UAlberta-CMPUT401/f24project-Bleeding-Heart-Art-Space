## Section 2

In the volunteer view, volunteers only have access to two tabs on the sidebar, Overview and Calendar. The two icons on the top right are for a light-mode/dark mode toggle and profile page respectively.

### **Overview**

Overview will display the signed-up shifts that the volunteer has signed up for the next two weeks, as well as Events upcoming in the next two weeks.  
The shifts that the user has signed up for will have buttons for check in and checkout, with checkout being automatically done for the user after the checkout time has been passed.  
The shifts and events will have buttons linking to the information for that event as well.

### **Shift sign up**

Upon sign up, users will be given the option to add notes to their signed up shift. For example, if they would like to remind themselves or the admin of anything for that particular event (bringing extra volunteers, needing different equipment)

The artist view of the app is identical to the volunteer view with two added features, request event, and view Event requests.

### View Request

Here, in their calendar view, artists are able to click a button on the bottom right to request an event. 

<img width="730" alt="Screenshot 2024-12-03 at 2 33 28 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2bfe3a84-84d6-47d0-8aae-29ac4893462b">

### **View Event Requests**

The event requested will be sent to the Event requests page, which is only available to both Artists and Admins. 

- On the admin view, they will have the option to confirm or deny the request.  
- Once the option is confirmed, the event will be automatically confirmed onto the calendar.

## Section 4

The admin view gives the user access to mostly everything in the app, including being able to edit and delete users, events, and shifts.  
The admin view section adds in one more tab **Volunteer Management** where an admin can view the information of all users, change user roles, and create the different roles for the different shifts. A new icon has also been added in the top right for the admin’s to send emails to the volunteers.

### **Create Events**

In order to create an event, the user can either click on the calendar itself (which will automatically fill in the date) or click the button on the bottom right, which will bring up the dialog for creating an event.

<img width="730" alt="Screenshot 2024-12-03 at 2 35 11 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/22ea9de4-8148-4df4-9774-da7e2e5dbf73">

On event details, admin has access to two new buttons, edit event and edit shifts.   
Edit event will open up a dialog identical to the create event dialog with the information automatically inside, along with a delete event option, while edit shifts will open up a new page to mange the shifts for that event.

### **Create Shifts**

In create shifts, admins can specifically set up shifts for their event, edit shifts, and delete shifts

An admin can also view the notes that any volunteers put down by viewing the details of that particular shift in event details

### **Create volunteer Roles**

Volunteer management is where the admin can see all the users that have signed up for this app. 

- In the manage users tab, they can select anyone who has signed up and change their user role accordingly to: blocked, admin, artist, or volunteer. This will change their view of the app.  
- In the volunteer roles tab (keep in mind user roles are different from volunteer roles) admins are able to create volunteer roles for the various shifts needed for an event (gallery host, senior volunteer, photographer)

### **Emails**

In the top right corner, the mail icon will lead the icon to a page where they can send emails to all volunteers who have signed up for any shift for a particular event. Admin’s can also send bulk emails with a click of a button to all volunteers on the database, this will send information about the shifts for any event that has a start date of the current day/today of when the button is clicked.
